# OTP-SMS-Service
A lightweight Python Flask-based API for generating and sending OTP (One-Time Password) codes via SMS. The service validates international phone numbers (E.164 format, e.g., +855101234567) using a regex pattern and responds with a randomly generated OTP for secure authentication workflows.
